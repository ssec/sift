SIFT Developer Documentation
============================

SIFT, Satellite Information Familiarization Tool, is a GUI application
for viewing and analyzing earth-observing satellite data. This documentation
is meant for developers of SIFT or those interested in the low-level details
(programming interfaces, public APIs, overall designs, etc).
For general information on the use of SIFT, official releases, and
installation instructions of those releases see the SIFT
`home page <http://sift.ssec.wisc.edu/>`_. Note that the library and
python package for the SIFT project are named ``uwsift``.

For source code and other information now provided by the home page see
the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ssec/sift>`_. Some of the
original design documentation of SIFT can be found on the repository's
`wiki <https://github.com/ssec/sift/wiki>`_. This site's documentation
will slowly replace the low-level documents on the wiki.
